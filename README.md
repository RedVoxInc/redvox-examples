# RedVox Examples

This repository is for case-studies, examples, and tutorials using the [redvox SDK](https://github.com/RedVoxInc/redvox-python-sdk)
and [pandas pipeline](https://github.com/RedVoxInc/redpandas).

Refer to the [guidelines](https://github.com/RedVoxInc/redvox-examples/blob/main/README_guidelines.md) on how to add examples to this repository.

We recommend you start with the [first example (ex_00 report_audio)](https://github.com/RedVoxInc/redvox-examples/tree/main/examples/ex_00_report_audio),
which loads audio data from a Redvox report downloaded from [redvox.io](https://redvox.io/#/home).

Please note that you must have an [account on redvox.io](https://redvox.io/#/login) in order to access the data.  You may 
[sign up for a free account here](https://redvox.io/#/registration).
