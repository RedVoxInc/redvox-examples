# RedVox Examples

This repository is for case-studies, examples, and tutorials using the [redvox SDK](https://github.com/RedVoxInc/redvox-python-sdk)
and [pandas pipeline](https://github.com/RedVoxInc/redpandas).

We recommend you start with the [first example (ex_00 report_audio)](https://github.com/RedVoxInc/redvox-examples/tree/main/examples/ex_00_report_audio),
which loads audio data from a [Redvox report downloaded from redvox.io](https://redvox.io/#/reports/E328).
