### Time
Although human-readable local time is more readily accessible in daily life, 
our computations use Unix time (also referred to as the epoch time) UTC, 
the number of seconds since 1 January 1970 relative to the Greenwich meridian. 
Present-day smartphone audio systems are able to record at 192 kHz, 
corresponding to a sampling interval of 5.2 microseconds. 
Throughout this work, the native unit of time for computations is represented as the epoch time in microseconds.
