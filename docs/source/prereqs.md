# Prerequisites

In order to run the [RedVox SDK](https://github.com/RedVoxInc/redvox-python-sdk) and 
[RedPandas](https://github.com/RedVoxInc/redpandas) examples:

1. You must be able to run Python scripts on your machine.  The SDK and RedPandas are designed to run on Python version 
   3.8 or higher.  We recommend using a virtual Python environment if possible.
2. You must be able to install Python packages via `pip` or another method on your machine.
3. You must have access to the internet via a web browser.
4. You must be able to edit Python files via an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), text editor or another method.

Once the prerequisites are in place, you can [setup your environment to run the examples](getting_data_from_report.md).
